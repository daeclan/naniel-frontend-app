    <h1>About Naniel App</h1>
  <p><b>naniel</b> is an app that people can use to donate objects directly to charitable causes, allowing the user to choose what their cause is (or who their Naniel is) and allows them to set the price of their donated object with 100% of the proceeds going to the people or charities  in need. The app also functions as a philanthropic art community where artists can connect and share their concerns for the world. </p>

  <p>I met Naniel in 4th grade when he moved up to Maine from Massachusetts. He brought me up on good hip hop, nacho nights, Steven Segal movies, and some real stylish movies. He is the best kind of person. Sadly, he got sick & I have been thinking of ways to help support him & his family (who have to cover a lot of expenses out of pocket). After talking with him, and getting his approval, I went ahead and began building the Naniel app. </p>
