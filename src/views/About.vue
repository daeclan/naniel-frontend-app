    <h1>About Naniel app</h1>
  <p>naniel is an app that artists can use to donate their art directly to charitable causes, allowing the user (artist/collector) to choose what their cause is (or who their Naniel is) and allows them to set the price of their art product (with 100% of the proceeds going to the people in need). The app also functions as a philanthropic art community where artists can connect and share their concerns for the world. </p>

  <p>i met naniel in 4th grade when he moved up to maine from massachusetts. he brought my up on good hip hop and good vibes. he is the best kind of person. but sadly, he got sick & i have been thinking of ways to help support him & his family (who have to cover a lot of expenses out of pocket). after talking with him, and getting his approval, i went ahead and began building the Naniel app. </p>
