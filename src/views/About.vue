    <h1>About Naniel app</h1>
  <p>naniel is an app that artists can use to donate their art directly to charitable causes, allowing the user (artist/collector) to choose what their cause is (or who their Naniel is) and allows them to set the price of their art product (with 100% of the proceeds going to the people in need). The app also functions as a philanthropic art community where artists can connect and share their concerns for the world. </p>
